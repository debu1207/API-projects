# API-projects
A country has a lot of universities and colleges. A international student would always like to know what are the universities or colleges in his/her neighbouring or any other countries.
He/she will also like to go to their website right from the application. So, you can just find your university or college and double click it to go to its website.
This projects obviously shows how cool is an API and how can we use an API in lots of interesting ways. This project can be further modified.

NOTE:
  For this application to work please use the official name of the country.
  For example, for Russia use "Russian Federation" and for UK use "United Kingdom", etc.
